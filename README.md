# Introduction
Project name - Integrating Energy Efficiency Output Specifications and Dedicated Evaluation Methods into Electronic Public Procurement
Location - Ukraine
Beneficiary - Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Agriculture - http://www.me.gov.ua/
Project dates - 2019-2020

## Background
Ukraine has an e-procurement system (ProZorro) but the level of contracts awarded for environmentally friendly energy efficient goods and services is low. To address this, it is necessary to promote the use of methods of tender evaluation that take to account energy efficiency criteria, enable the adoption of energy efficient performance specifications for selected goods and services and encourage their use during the planning and preparation phase of public tenders by contracting authorities. With public procurement conducted electronically on ProZorro, promoting energy efficiency is expected to be best achieved by developing online tools supporting preparation of technical specifications for energy efficiency sensitive goods, such as a technical specification builder, automated evaluation mechanisms promoting environmental friendly award criteria and e-catalogues facilitating purchase of energy efficient goods by public sector. Further integration of these online tools into ProZorro and adoption by the Centralized Procurement Body shall encourage  and facilitate their use by local contracting authorities.​

## Objectives of the project
Increase the visibility of energy efficiency horizontal policy in national public procurement processes, which allows for better transparency and better insights into efficiency of public procurements;​

Improve the level of understanding of the complex energy efficiency evaluation by government, business, citizens and civil society organizations;​

Increase the use of life-cycle costing method in planning of energy-sensitive products procurement;​

Simplify the procurement of energy-sensitive products and increase the adoption of environmental-friendly award criteria in the ProZorro system;​

Establish an analytical infrastructure to track the performance, including generated savings, of energy-sensitive products procurement.​

## Technological approach
Annual and lifetime electricity, financial savings and paybacks calculators integrated with ProZorro; ​

A catalogue of energy efficient products available on the local market in order to enable easy online purchasing from e-catalogues integrated with ProZorro;​

Online technical specification building tool integrated with ProZorro; ​

Business intelligence tool based on the Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) data. ​

## Project results and key achievements

Online technical specification builder with a catalogue of energy-efficiency products, integrated financial payback calculator and automated evaluation mechanisms is developed and adopted by the State-owned enterprise “ProZorro” and State Institution Centralized Procurement Body (SI CPB) “Professional Procurement” - infobox.prozorro.org/EnergyEfficiency ​

Dedicated business intelligence tool to track energy-efficient products procurement performance and make evidence-based decisions for future procurement planning and policy-making is developed.​

5 contracting entities conducted 6 purchases of energy-sensitive products (345 bulbs) using the developed tools and methodologies. Total value of purchases is UAH 19 040,40. Financial lifecycle savings - ; Energy lifeclycle savings - ​

New approaches to energy-sensitive products procurement are widely promoted by the SoE “ProZorro”, SI CPB “Professional Procurement”, and other stakeholders.
